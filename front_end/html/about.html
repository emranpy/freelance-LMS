<h2>About CodeBuddy</h2>

<p>CodeBuddy was created by the <a href="https://piccolo.byu.edu" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Piccolo lab</a>. Our goal is to enable people around the world to more effectively learn how to write code and analyze data. With this Web-based tool, instructors create programming and data-analysis exercises that are organized into courses, assignments, and problems. For each problem, learners are presented with a description of the problem, as well as the expected output. The learners must then write code to match the expected output. Depending on the problem, these outputs can be either text-based or graphics-based.</p>

<p>CodeBuddy provides simple yet innovative functionality, including the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Easy navigation among courses, assignments, and problems.</li>
    <li>Advanced code editing using <a href="https://ace.c9.io/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ace</a>.
    <li>The ability to create and edit problems via a graphical user interface. Problem descriptions are written using <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Markdown</a> syntax, thus providing simple yet flexible formatting.</li>
    <li>An extensible design that supports the ability to create coding problems for virtually any programming language (currently, Python, R, and shell scripting are supported).</li>
    <li>Interactive feedback when learners submit code, including a panel that highlights differences between the learners' output and the expected output.</li>
    <li>The ability for learners to view the instructor's solution after successfully completing a given problem.</li>
    <li>Reports that indicate which courses, assignments, and problems have been attempted and/or completed by each student.</li>
</ol>
